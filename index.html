        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Sociology ðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> Hi my name is Krystal Tran and I am 18 years old.
        I am currently a first year student at the University of California, Riverside
        pursuing in Sociology. I am a young adult with many experiences and interests.
        My current interests include binge watching youtube videos or listening to my favorite
        artists on repeat to relieve some stress. I currently have been pursuing in editing
        personal websites as well as some journaling to express my own creativity. As a young
        woman who has just started college, I do have a dream career I hope to pursue after I 
        finish school. My current dream career is to become a social worker where I am able to 
        help foster children stay on a successful path to pursue a beautiful future for themselves.
        I grew up not having as much as those around me, but my parents were an impactful role model 
        that kept pushing me to try harder and to chase after a dream. That is what I hope to be for 
        these foster children in the future one day. <br><br>

       Although I have not had much experience in this type of social work, I am currently 
       working towards it. I have had jobs in the past to help me out financially before I left 
       home for college that included foods service and sales associate positions. I have worked
       on my communication with the customers I have interacted with and made sure they always left with
       a smile on their face. I have learned how to manage my time as well as how to greet others in a way
       where they are able to feel special. Discipline, responsibility, and communication are big factors
       I will take into the future with me to gain more experience before I take a step into pursuing my dream
       career. Through these part-time jobs, I have gained experience that I will bring along with me in the 
       future to help me communicate with the children I will be working with. I will do my best to make sure 
       the children I work with in the future will grow up with a smile on their face. <br><br>

        Foster kids are known to struggle a lot in school as well as in their own personal
        lives. I want them to be reminded everyday through my work that they are someone who
        is important for this world and that all the work that they will do will matter for the
        future. I hope in the future I am able to travel all around the world to share my knowledge
        with the children that might have a mindset where they think they will not be able to make 
        it. I want to be an impactful role model as well as someone they can rely on to help them 
        know that they are not alone. This is a dream I hope to pursue in the future. Since I know how much of an influence I can 
        be in someone's life, I am willing to do whatever it takes to make that change in the world.
        I will continue to work hard towards this goal as a sociology student at UCR.
